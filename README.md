# Data-Centric Cohort Refinement for Clinical Risk Prediction

This repository contains the full implementation of our paper:

**"A Data-Centric and Interpretable Framework for Clinical Risk Prediction via Cohort Refinement"**

We present a modular framework that improves predictive modeling by refining patient cohorts using odds ratio filtering, Isolation Forest anomaly detection, and Shapley-based sample attribution.

## 📌 Dataset: MIMIC-IV

This project uses the publicly available [MIMIC-IV](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/2.2/) database from PhysioNet.

> ⚠️ Due to data use agreements, we do not include raw MIMIC-IV files in this repository.  
> Please obtain access via PhysioNet and prepare the following:
- `labevents.csv`: laboratory events (including creatinine, ItemID 50912)
- `mimc_organize.csv`: organized admissions file with `subject_id` and `admittime`

## ⚙️ Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Key packages:
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`
- `keras` (TensorFlow backend)
- `xgboost`
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `tqdm`
